# AutoCypherBible
A little tool I made to generate complex numerical cyphers, in PDF form.

## How to use?
install numpy and rlextra from reportlab (https://www.reportlab.com/)
run bible.py
unless you broke something, it should output a pdf & the jsonified mappings (to programatically encode/decode instead of manually doing it)
